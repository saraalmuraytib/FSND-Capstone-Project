## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies for the Backend

1. **Python 3.7**
2. **Flask**  as server framework
3. **Virtual Enviornment** Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
4. **PIP Dependencies** 
install dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

5. **Key Dependencies**

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM.
-  [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.
- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests if we have.
- Flask-Migrate for creating and running schema migrations

## Running the server - Backend
First ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.
To run the server, execute:
```bash
flask run --reload
```
The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.
The server will running on [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) or [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/)

## Testing

To run the tests, run
```
python test_app.py
```
